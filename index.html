  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <h2>background Information</h2>

  <p> I was born on November 12, 2003 in Colombo Sri Lanka. I was born into a family of four. Who are my mum (who loves bossing the whole family around and security is the boss of all of us), My dad ( the only one who obeys my mum willingly), My older sister (the one one who thinks she’s the most intelligent one) and me (the one whos obsessed with food). My family made a massive decision to move to Australia due to the poor education and the security and some financial situations in Sri Lanka. For me Culture is a lifestyle and roots of who we are. I am fluent in Sinhalese and English.  When I first moved to Australia, I lived in Perth Baldivis for a couple years. Whilst living in Perth my best friend got me into dance (calisthenics) and musicals. Then after a couple years my family decided to move again to Point Cook, Melbourne where I graduated from highschool. Due to moving states I  couldn't continue dancing so I then decided to get into the gym lifestyle. However I still got the chance to be in Legally blonde the musical in 2019 and Shrek the musical in 2018.  One fact that many people may not know about me or may know too much is that I am a musical nerd and I am not even ashamed of admitting it because Deep down I fantasize about living in a world where people would just dance and sing  and have perfect hair and clothes whenever they feel like. Many of my friends viewed it as a bad thing because I may not see the realistic side of particular situations but having a different unique or even a positive attribution/ opinions can be a fun trait to have in a person. That may even solve some situations sometimes or at least it can be entertaining. I have been to watch 6 stage musicals so far. My favorite one so far was Hamilton which I went to watch recently and it was one of the best experiences I have had in my entire life. Other than Hamilton I’ve seen Mamma Mia, Legally Blonde the musical, Shrek the musical, Ruthless and Six the musical.

  <p>I am personally a major music fan. As of now I have listened to more than 7 different languages worth of songs. I got into music because of my family background. My dad and sister used to sing in various different shows back in Sri Lanka. Due to that my family always had parties, music shows, concerts almost every weekend. So I love going out and having social gatherings with drinks, dancing and songs and LOADS of food. My family sees it as a stress reliever of sorts. After a stressful week of studies or work, going out to a party or a show can make you relaxed and allow you to have a little fun. Unfortunately since moving to Australia we haven't had the chance to go to parties or go to a concert. However I replaced that need with musicals. My dream musicals to watch as of now are Wicked, Matilda, Phantom Of The Opera and Dear Evan Hensen. </p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h5>
  <p>The first thought that came into my mind when I heard of IT was simply just Google search and YouTube. I've always found the concept of technology interesting as it can be anything we shape it to be. Technology always upgrades which moldes into endless possibilities for the future. Technology also expands into six categories or components called communication (internet, television, phones), Electrical (computers, hardware, AR, VR), Energy (batteries, solar panels, etc.), Mechanical (manufacturing, engineering, ect), Medical (surgical , monitoring, ect) and lastly Transportation (GPS, Flights or vehicles).  Even though these main components are being used in our day to day lives , we as humans mainly view technology as the ‘Internet’. The internet is perceived as many things such as a source of entertainment, Broadcast information service, Multicast information service or just a  database of answers.
As I mentioned earlier the Internet opens a door to endless possibilities for their users globally. When the door of infinite possibilities opens, the users attempt to be creative to make their own fantasies become a reality, which can be either a positive outcome or a negative outcome for the audience. It might be an uncommon interest however I find the  negative aspect  of this intriguing because it allows me to have an understanding of those negative parts so then I can do something to prevent them from happening. This is why I am looking into becoming a cyber security engineer as I want to protect online users from a bad experience when using the internet. I started researching in this field since I found out about the web browser called the dark web which captivated me. This browser is very fascinating to me because of the variety of personalities shared within this browser. Not everyone can or should be able to access this web browser, this is because of this  browser's unlimited possibilities, opportunities as it  is all anonymously done. No one knows exactly who created what or who shared what or even who is watching. That's the captivating factor about Information technology.
</p>
<h5>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h5>
<p>Personally I love watching random documentaries about Con artists, killers, mysteries. One day I was just laying on bed eating dark chocolate and I came across this video on YouTube about “The dark side of the silk road” which was about a platform used to sell drugs and unauthorized substances on tor browser. Watching more deep into the documentary I found out about the “Cicada 3301 The internet mystery” which was a puzzle game found on Tor for Tor users to solve. I found more and more videos and articles which I spent hours watching or reading that related back to the Tor browser. But I never really dug deeper into the browser then one day I Googled the term ‘Tor browser’. That's when I explored the other side of the internet. Which terrified me yet kept me on the edge of the seat wanting to explore deeper and deeper into it. The more I explored the browser or the people who use the browser, the more I realized that the Internet is much more than what the surface allows the normal users to see.

<h5>Why did you choose to come to rmit?</h5>
<p>During High school the teachers and parents force us to pick this one specific subject we all love to do for the rest of our life. At the age of 17 or 18 I didn't know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I just wanted to sleep, eat and watch documentaries. However I knew what areas I didn't enjoy and I knew the subject I am passionate about. The only problem was that I didn't know specifically what I wanted to do in that area I was passionate about. For example , I was very passionate about technology/ cyber security, project management ,networking and machine hardware.  Obviously I couldn't study all of them at once so I had to choose a course which allowed me to study all of the areas that I liked and explore which one I liked the best. When I first explored RMIT courses the first one which attracted me was Bachelors of IT due to the fact that it touches all the areas which I liked. RMIT is also located in a convenient location.</p>

<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
<p>The reason I picked the course is to learn every component which has to do with Information technology. Such as web computing, data management, cyber security, artificial intelligence, systems administrations and ect. I want to expand my knowledge in all of these majors as well as pick a specific subject which I like more than others in order for me to study further. </p>

<h5>Why be a cybersecuirty engineer?</h5>
<p>Cybersecurity engineering caught my eye due to the fact that it has multiple areas,  roles and responsibilities. The role of a cybersecurity engineer is to identify threats and vulnerabilities in systems and software, then apply their knowledge and skills to develop and implement solutions to defend against hacking, malware and ransomware or to any inside threats and all types of cybercrime happening in a specific company.  The responsibilities that fall under this job are Examining the organization's current security issues, Set up firewalls and intrusion detection systems, customizing them to meet the organization's demands, Analyzing threats and performing regular security audits, Putting in place an automated system within the company to guarantee that security policies are effective and efficient, investigating security breaches and put in place sound incident response strategies, learning from prior mistakes to develop even more robust security processes, Keeping up with industry standards and make sure you're in full compliance, Conducting  tests and provide informative insights based on the results. Analyzing evolved security needs throughout a product's lifespan and ensuring that they are addressed at each step, Observing  any changes inside the organization to ensure that security is not jeopardized, Outline the company's internal security rules, Recommend additional development to maintain the company in compliance with security best practices.
</p>
<p>The part which makes it appealing for me is that doing this job makes me have to use a wide range of knowledge and skills at once. Also the work may vary depending on the issue or the threat the company gets. Any job, especially security job related IT, allows me to be updated with the world and system as it develops with time because it is important to recognise and be aware of new ways in which people might hack into the system or new computer threats. The job also pays extremely well and sometimes allows workers to work from home giving me more time to gain skills which may help me against threats. </p>

<h5>My cureent experiences</h5>
<p>As of now I have zero experience in professional coding. However I have done two years of data analytics and I am pretty good at problem solving. Cyber security engineering requires basic networking skills which I learned during my high school years. During those two years I have learned a bit of how to manage a project by using the tool Microsoft project. I have also learned and mastered how to use excel with various different formulas and methods.</p>

<h5>Basic plan</h5>
<p>My basic plan in order to get to that pathway from where I am standing now is long. Starting at getting an ATAR above 65 in order to get into bachelors of Information technology at RMIT which I am currently in. The second step is to graduate and learn the basics components  of Information technology such as User centered design, networking, project management, software engineering and many other components. This provides me with a lot of knowledge that I may need when in the working field. After graduating bachelors of Information technology which takes up to 3 years, which is required to move on to the master of Cyber Security which takes about 2 years full time studying. Which majors in Discrete math, cryptography, coding for cyber communication, applied analysis, machine learning, networking, cloud networking, IT infrastructure and security. After completing these 2 years of masters I will be qualified academically to get into the job field in cybersecurity engineering. However, gaining industry experience is equally as important as gaining academic knowledge. Going into career expos from RMIT and gaining contacts from industry specialists can get me experience required for the final job.

<h3>16 Personality test</h3>
<h6>commander Personality</h6>
<p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.

</p>

<h3>Am I a nerd? </h3>
<p>I personally view myself to be in between the lines of nerdy and  unintelligent. According to the openpsychomectrics.org the nerdy personality attributes scale measures a single score which could be described as an “overall neardiness”. High shreds have personalities typical of the average person who describes themselves as a nerd and low scores do not.  I got a score of 36 on the scale.</p>

<h3>What Disney character am I?</h3>
<p>According to a Buzzfeed questionnaire I am like Flynn Rider from tangled. Because I like to hide behind my wit and charming personality, however I am a really big softie. I am  a very independent person who has big dreams and will do whatever it takes to m</p>

<h3>What zodiac sign am i? </h3>
<h4>Scorpio</h4>
<p>Scorpios are passionate, independent and unafraid to blaze their own trail no matter what others may think, scorpios make a statement wherever they go. We love to debate, and aren't afraid of controversy and won't back down without proving our point. We also hate people who aren't genuine, and are all about being authentic.
Due to all these traits we as scorpios may appear to be intimidating and somewhat closed off to those who don't know us well. But what people don't realize is that even though scorpio may seem blunt, as a water sign we are also very tuned with our emotions and sometimes may find ourselves caught up in our feelings.
Our feelings are what drive us and strengthen us, but our mutability can scare and make us feel vulnerable and out of control. Because of this conflict, scorpios, like our namesake, the scorpion, put up an outer shell and may seem prickly. </p>

<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
<p>16 personality tests and results made me aware of my dominating desire to make decisions in
The common personality all these tests have is that I am a closed book however very emotionally aware. I love being in control of everything and frankly I love to control my surroundings according to what I think is the best. Which can be a negative personality trait as what i may think may not always be the best for others.
These tests highlighted some of the personalities my friends and family have said which I radiate but didn't want to believe. Being a closed book and having the ability to hide emotions was normal for me however the more I became closer with people and esepessionaly being in a relationship made me realize that having that personality can be difficult for the other party to figure out where my head is in certain situations.

According to these tests I appear as a dominant and intimidating person. In a workplace environment it can be a positive personality trait as it can help when it comes to decision making and leading a group to a straight goal without anyone being sidetracked. However a constraint of this personality is that people or colleagues around me may get intimidated or overwhelmed with me.

After doing the disney questionnaire i have realized the emotional side of my personality as i can react to situations in a  sensitive manner when it shouldn't be taken into account in that manner at all. However when the heart speaks it can be quite difficult to make decisions.
</p>
<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3>
<p>According to the tests I will work well in a group atmosphere however it depends on the participants in the group. If the group participants are well organized and are willing to follow the guidelines, it will be easier to achieve the goal without any disagreements. However if the group doesn't know how to follow simple rules or not get side tracked along the way. It will be quite difficult to be in a group with me.
Some of the personalities I have can clash with most people however I personally work well with others due to the fact that, if one person dont understand a certain something the group mates can help them. In my point of view group members shouldnt have competition with one another. When the group
</p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>When forming a group it would be ideal for me to choose people who have the same personality types as me. Such as bubbly or outgoing with other people in the group. When the group members are helping each other and looking out for each other whilst making good decisions on the way. The goal can be achieved easily. Group work can be very efficient and productive. </p>
