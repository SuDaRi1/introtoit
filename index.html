  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <h2>background Information</h2>

  <p> I was born on November 12, 2003 in Colombo Sri Lanka. I was born into a family of four. Who are my mum (who loves bossing the whole family around and security is the boss of all of us), My dad ( the only one who obeys my mum willingly), My older sister (the one one who thinks she’s the most intelligent one) and me (the one whos obsessed with food). My family made a massive decision to move to Australia due to the poor education and the security and some financial situations in Sri Lanka. For me Culture is a lifestyle and roots of who we are. I am fluent in Sinhalese and English.  When I first moved to Australia, I lived in Perth Baldivis for a couple years. Whilst living in Perth my best friend got me into dance (calisthenics) and musicals. Then after a couple years my family decided to move again to Point Cook, Melbourne where I graduated from highschool. Due to moving states I  couldn't continue dancing so I then decided to get into the gym lifestyle. However I still got the chance to be in Legally blonde the musical in 2019 and Shrek the musical in 2018.  One fact that many people may not know about me or may know too much is that I am a musical nerd and I am not even ashamed of admitting it because Deep down I fantasize about living in a world where people would just dance and sing  and have perfect hair and clothes whenever they feel like. Many of my friends viewed it as a bad thing because I may not see the realistic side of particular situations but having a different unique or even a positive attribution/ opinions can be a fun trait to have in a person. That may even solve some situations sometimes or at least it can be entertaining. I have been to watch 6 stage musicals so far. My favorite one so far was Hamilton which I went to watch recently and it was one of the best experiences I have had in my entire life. Other than Hamilton I’ve seen Mamma Mia, Legally Blonde the musical, Shrek the musical, Ruthless and Six the musical.

  <p>I am personally a major music fan. As of now I have listened to more than 7 different languages worth of songs. I got into music because of my family background. My dad and sister used to sing in various different shows back in Sri Lanka. Due to that my family always had parties, music shows, concerts almost every weekend. So I love going out and having social gatherings with drinks, dancing and songs and LOADS of food. My family sees it as a stress reliever of sorts. After a stressful week of studies or work, going out to a party or a show can make you relaxed and allow you to have a little fun. Unfortunately since moving to Australia we haven't had the chance to go to parties or go to a concert. However I replaced that need with musicals. My dream musicals to watch as of now are Wicked, Matilda, Phantom Of The Opera and Dear Evan Hensen. </p>
