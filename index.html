  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <h2>background Information</h2>

  <p> I was born on November 12, 2003 in Colombo Sri Lanka. I was born into a family of four. Who are my mum (who loves bossing the whole family around and security is the boss of all of us), My dad ( the only one who obeys my mum willingly), My older sister (the one one who thinks she’s the most intelligent one) and me (the one whos obsessed with food). My family made a massive decision to move to Australia due to the poor education and the security and some financial situations in Sri Lanka. For me Culture is a lifestyle and roots of who we are. I am fluent in Sinhalese and English.  When I first moved to Australia, I lived in Perth Baldivis for a couple years. Whilst living in Perth my best friend got me into dance (calisthenics) and musicals. Then after a couple years my family decided to move again to Point Cook, Melbourne where I graduated from highschool. Due to moving states I  couldn't continue dancing so I then decided to get into the gym lifestyle. However I still got the chance to be in Legally blonde the musical in 2019 and Shrek the musical in 2018.  One fact that many people may not know about me or may know too much is that I am a musical nerd and I am not even ashamed of admitting it because Deep down I fantasize about living in a world where people would just dance and sing  and have perfect hair and clothes whenever they feel like. Many of my friends viewed it as a bad thing because I may not see the realistic side of particular situations but having a different unique or even a positive attribution/ opinions can be a fun trait to have in a person. That may even solve some situations sometimes or at least it can be entertaining. I have been to watch 6 stage musicals so far. My favorite one so far was Hamilton which I went to watch recently and it was one of the best experiences I have had in my entire life. Other than Hamilton I’ve seen Mamma Mia, Legally Blonde the musical, Shrek the musical, Ruthless and Six the musical.

  <p>I am personally a major music fan. As of now I have listened to more than 7 different languages worth of songs. I got into music because of my family background. My dad and sister used to sing in various different shows back in Sri Lanka. Due to that my family always had parties, music shows, concerts almost every weekend. So I love going out and having social gatherings with drinks, dancing and songs and LOADS of food. My family sees it as a stress reliever of sorts. After a stressful week of studies or work, going out to a party or a show can make you relaxed and allow you to have a little fun. Unfortunately since moving to Australia we haven't had the chance to go to parties or go to a concert. However I replaced that need with musicals. My dream musicals to watch as of now are Wicked, Matilda, Phantom Of The Opera and Dear Evan Hensen. </p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h5>
  <p>The first thought that came into my mind when I heard of IT was simply just Google search and YouTube. I've always found the concept of technology interesting as it can be anything we shape it to be. Technology always upgrades which moldes into endless possibilities for the future. Technology also expands into six categories or components called communication (internet, television, phones), Electrical (computers, hardware, AR, VR), Energy (batteries, solar panels, etc.), Mechanical (manufacturing, engineering, ect), Medical (surgical , monitoring, ect) and lastly Transportation (GPS, Flights or vehicles).  Even though these main components are being used in our day to day lives , we as humans mainly view technology as the ‘Internet’. The internet is perceived as many things such as a source of entertainment, Broadcast information service, Multicast information service or just a  database of answers.
As I mentioned earlier the Internet opens a door to endless possibilities for their users globally. When the door of infinite possibilities opens, the users attempt to be creative to make their own fantasies become a reality, which can be either a positive outcome or a negative outcome for the audience. It might be an uncommon interest however I find the  negative aspect  of this intriguing because it allows me to have an understanding of those negative parts so then I can do something to prevent them from happening. This is why I am looking into becoming a cyber security engineer as I want to protect online users from a bad experience when using the internet. I started researching in this field since I found out about the web browser called the dark web which captivated me. This browser is very fascinating to me because of the variety of personalities shared within this browser. Not everyone can or should be able to access this web browser, this is because of this  browser's unlimited possibilities, opportunities as it  is all anonymously done. No one knows exactly who created what or who shared what or even who is watching. That's the captivating factor about Information technology.
</p>
<h5>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h5>
<p>Personally I love watching random documentaries about Con artists, killers, mysteries. One day I was just laying on bed eating dark chocolate and I came across this video on YouTube about “The dark side of the silk road” which was about a platform used to sell drugs and unauthorized substances on tor browser. Watching more deep into the documentary I found out about the “Cicada 3301 The internet mystery” which was a puzzle game found on Tor for Tor users to solve. I found more and more videos and articles which I spent hours watching or reading that related back to the Tor browser. But I never really dug deeper into the browser then one day I Googled the term ‘Tor browser’. That's when I explored the other side of the internet. Which terrified me yet kept me on the edge of the seat wanting to explore deeper and deeper into it. The more I explored the browser or the people who use the browser, the more I realized that the Internet is much more than what the surface allows the normal users to see.
